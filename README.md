# MailingApp
This was a self-learning task done by me during my college
This is a java web application that can be used to send mail to multiple receipients at once

How it works:
->Get an excel sheet which contains all the mail address of recipients 
->Start the application and select the excel file which you have prepared
->Input the subject and message that need to be sent to all the recipients and click on Send button
->After completing sending the mails, the application will generate an output excel file which contains the information if the mail is successfuly sent for each recipient
