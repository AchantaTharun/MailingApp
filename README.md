# MailingApp
This was a self-learning task done by me during my college<br>
This is a java web application that can be used to send mail to multiple receipients at once<br>

How it works:<br>
->Get an excel sheet which contains all the mail address of recipients <br>
->Start the application and select the excel file which you have prepared<br>
->Input the subject and message that need to be sent to all the recipients and click on Send button<br>
->After completing sending the mails, the application will generate an output excel file which contains the information if the mail is successfuly sent for each recipient<br>
